## 4.1 Getting the Basics: Complex Natural Systems, Causality and History

Ecologists frequently face the challenge of explaining complex natural systems. In such endeavors, linear regression alone becomes insufficient. *Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)* offers a valuable framework for analyzing complex, multivariate relationships in natural systems more effectively.

For example, Zhu et al. (2023) employed SEM to explore the effects of grazing cattle on the arthropod community in grassland ecosystems. First, they developed a conceptual framework that outlines all the direct and indirect pathways between the large herbivores and the arthropod community (see Figure 4.1). Cattle can directly affect arthropod populations, for example, by trampling or unintentionally eating them. Additionally, they modify the vegetation and abiotic conditions of the environment, which indirectly influences arthropods by altering their habitat. These direct and indirect effects collectively reshape arthropod community structures, disrupt trophic interactions, and create cascading effects throughout the arthropod food web.

![**Figure 4.1: Conceptual map of the direct and indirect relationships between cattle and the arthropod community** <br>This conceptual framework illustrates how cattle impact the arthropod community and their food web directly or indirectly through vegetation characteristics and abiotic conditions. The arrows represent the pathways. Cattle reduce plant quantity through defoliation. Plant quality and diversity may change because of selective feeding, altered soil nutrient cycling, or shifted plant community composition. Grazing may reduce vegetation height and modify structural heterogeneity. Feeding and trampling can affect soil properties and the microclimate. Large herbivores may increase the mortality rate of arthropods through unintentional predation and trampling. Cattle also introduce resources such as dung and their biomass. The grazers and arthropods may compete for resources such as plant biomass. The combined alterations of the environment and the direct effects influence the abundance and biomass of arthropods in varying trophic guilds, thereby affecting food web interactions. The figure synthesizes the frameworks of van Klink et al. (2015) and Zhu et al. (2023).](Figures_Memes/‎Figure_1.jpeg){width="90%"}

This example highlights the limitations of univariate regression ($y = a + bx + \epsilon$). Conventional univariate analyses do not allow for incorporating multiple dependent variables, nor can variables function simultaneously as predictors and responses. In the case of grassland ecosystems, cattle affect several dependent variables, including vegetation characteristics, microclimate, and arthropod populations. Furthermore, vegetation acts both as a response and as a predictor, mediating the indirect effects of cattle on the arthropod community. These cascading effects cannot be accurately captured by using univariate methods. In contrast, SEM provides a framework for representing and analyzing multivariate, interacting systems.

Structural Equation Models

:   are probabilistic multivariate models designed to test and evaluate pre-assumed networks of causal relationships. They rely on the principles of regression analysis. The causal networks are visually described in path diagrams whose pathways can be expressed mathematically through a series of equations (Figure 4.2).

This chapter begins by exploring a fundamental concept of SEM: *causation*. Following this, a historical overview provides insights into the evolution of SEM and the ongoing shifts in its definition. The next section of the chapter delves into the statistical methodologies used in SEM, covering path diagrams, traditional SEM, and the more contemporary piecewise SEM framework. A case study illustrates the application of piecewise SEM in R using the *piecewiseSEM* package. The chapter concludes with an overview of advanced techniques, practical recommendations for application, and common pitfalls to avoid. Finally, you can apply what you have learned through an exercise.

### 4.1.1 How to: Causation

![](Figures_Memes/meme2.jpg){width="70%"}

The previous definition highlighted that SEM is designed to test and evaluate pre-assumed networks of **causal** relationships. In contrast, traditional modeling approaches often emphasize that "*correlation does not imply causation.*" This subchapter examines how SEM diverges from conventional techniques regarding the concept of causation.

Most prominently, SEM distinguishes itself by not relying on null hypothesis testing, a framework commonly used in many scientific disciplines. In this traditional approach, the first step is formulating a null hypothesis, which typically assumes no difference between groups. This null hypothesis is then compared to an alternative hypothesis, stating that the groups differ in their mean.

In contrast, the initial step within the SEM framework involves creating a theory-based model that outlines a network of causal links, such as the direct and indirect effects of cattle on arthropod communities (see Figure 4.1). After developing the model, it is tested by comparing the observed data to the expected outcomes derived from the model. The entire model is rejected if the data does not align with the theoretical assumptions. In other words, this process entails comparing a theoretical causal network to the observed data, whereas traditional modeling compares a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis.

This approach to testing and evaluating a model, constructed on a solid foundation of prior knowledge and evidence, enables the inference of causation. SEM identifies statistical dependencies, subject to causal interpretation based on supporting evidence and theoretical frameworks. Simply put, it is not the statistical results that determine causation but your informed interpretations of these outcomes that provide causal insights.

In summary, SEM starts by constructing a pre-assumed model grounded in your extensive knowledge of the system. This emphasis on a theory-based model allows for the inference of causal relationships.

### 4.1.2 The Evolution of Structural Equation Models

Throughout its history, SEM has continually developed while the ongoing advancements expanded its application across various scientific fields. The origin of SEM dates back to the early 20th century, and its evolution can be categorized into three distinct generations.

The first generation traces back to Sewall Wright's development of Path Analysis, a multivariate approach that accounts for multiple causes and responses. Path Analysis employs a graphical representation of the model (see Figure 4.2). Through his work, Wright laid the groundwork for causal inference, providing essential insights into model building and interpretation.

A significant advancement in the modern formulation of SEM occurred in the early 1970s when Karl Jöreskog integrated Path Analysis and Factor Analysis (see Box 1) within the LISREL (*Linear Structural Relations*) model. This pivotal innovation marked the beginning of the second-generation SEM. One of Jöreskog's most notable contributions was incorporating the maximum likelihood approach. Maximum likelihood methods improved the assessment of overall model fit by analyzing covariances (refer to Chapter 4.2.2 for more details). Remember that SEM starts by formulating a theory-based causal model that is tested against empirical data. Consequently, the evaluation of overall model fit is essential.

The third generation of SEM is characterized by several noteworthy advancements. This chapter primarily focuses on piecewise SEM, an approach that no longer depends on maximum likelihood methods and covariance analysis. Piecewise SEM addresses some of the most significant limitations of second-generation SEM, enabling the simultaneous incorporation of non-normal distributions, random effects, and various sampling designs. Later, the chapter will further explore the differences between second-generation SEM and piecewise SEM.

#### Revised Definition: SEM With Only Observed Variables

Over the past century, the definition of SEM has evolved continuously. However, some prevailing definitions, particularly in the social sciences where SEM has been more commonly applied, may not be well-suited for ecological research of natural systems. It is crucial to be aware of these varying definitions, as they can influence the applicability of SEM in different disciplines.

In social sciences, SEM is a framework for analyzing the relationship between observed and latent variables. This definition is closely associated with second-generation SEM, which synthesizes Path Analysis with Factor Analysis. In contrast, ecological research primarily focuses on observed variables. According to the prevailing definition in social sciences, the analysis of only observed variables falls within the framework of Path Analysis. However, it is necessary to acknowledge that *modern* Path Analysis has evolved alongside SEM, integrating advanced techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation. These techniques were not utilized in *historical* Path Analysis. Consequently, contemporary Path Analysis can be viewed as a specialized case of SEM, reflecting a more developed approach to examining relationships among observed variables.

The concept of SEM expanded further with the introduction of third-generation piecewise SEM. Often referred to as *Confirmatory Path Analysis*, piecewise SEM was initially designed to exclusively include observed variables. This methodology offers greater flexibility and enhances the applicability of SEM, as it accommodates the various data structures often encountered in ecological research. Nowadays, it may be more appropriate to describe SEM as a multivariate approach to regression.

### Box 1: Factor Analysis and Latent Variables

Factor Analysis involves the construction of latent (unmeasured) variables by estimating their value based on multiple observed variables. While the concept may be unfamiliar to you as a scientist, social scientists and psychologists utilize latent variables to quantify abstract constructs that are difficult to measure directly. For example, your motivation to continue reading cannot be measured directly. However, we can infer it through measurable variables such as the number of pages you've read today, the readability score of this text, and your academic background in statistics.
